# Oversampling
a comparision of different oversampling algorithms.

Here I have tried five different algorithms for oversampling and compared their performance based on four different parameters.
The four parameters are:-
1.Accuracy
2.Precision
3.Recall
4.F1 score

The five algorithms are:-
1.Without SMOTE
2. With SMOTE
3. With ADASYN
4. With Borderline SMOTE
5. With Safe level SMOTE.

The two datasets used are 
1. Pageblock dataset
2. Ecoli3 dataset
